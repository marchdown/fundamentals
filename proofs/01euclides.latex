\section{Euclides' proof of there being infinitely many prime numbers}
\subsection{Statement}

Let $P$ be prime numbers. There are infinitely many of them.


\subsection{Statement}
Equivalently, let $P$ be prime numbers. There is no $p \in P$ such that $\forall p' \in P : p' \leq p$.
% HWÃ†T how should I use colons and vertical bars in set comprehension notation?

\subsubsection{Proof}
Assume there is $p$ as defined above. Then $(p \cdot p) - 1$ is not divisible by any $p'$, and is greater than $p$, which gives us condradiction, which could only be because the assumption is false, thus, there is no maximum element in $P$.

% There was an error. I shoud write the proof in Agda or something.

\section{Mersenne's proof that for composite $n\; M_n = 2^n -1$ is composite as well}

\subsection{proof}
consider $n = a \cdot b$ and $2^n - 1= ((2^a)^{b-1} \cdot 2^a) - 1$. Then ...
